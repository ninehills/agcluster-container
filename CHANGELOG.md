## [0.2.0] - 2025-01-XX

### üéâ Major Features

#### Integrated Web UI Dashboard
- **NEW**: Full-featured Next.js 15 web interface with real-time monitoring
- Interactive dashboard for launching agents from preset configurations
- Real-time chat interface with Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming
- Visual agent builder with YAML preview and export
- Session management UI for monitoring active containers
- File browser with syntax highlighting and ZIP download
- Tool execution panel showing real-time Bash commands and file operations
- Task tracking with TodoWrite integration

#### Agent Configuration System
- **NEW**: YAML-based agent configuration with 4 preset templates:
  - `code-assistant`: Full-stack development with comprehensive tooling
  - `research-agent`: Web research and information synthesis
  - `data-analysis`: Statistical analysis with Jupyter notebook support
  - `fullstack-team`: Multi-agent orchestration with specialized sub-agents
- Support for inline custom configurations via API
- Per-agent resource limits (CPU, memory, storage)
- MCP server integration for custom tool servers
- Multi-agent orchestration capabilities

#### Multi-Provider Support
- **NEW**: Provider abstraction layer for multi-platform deployment
- Docker provider (local development and self-hosted)
- Fly Machines provider (production deployments)
- HTTP/SSE communication protocol for universal compatibility
- Foundation for Cloudflare and Vercel providers

#### File Operations API
- **NEW**: Complete file management system for agent workspaces
- Browse workspace files in tree structure (`GET /api/files/{session_id}`)
- Preview files with syntax highlighting and image support
- Download individual files with proper MIME types
- Export entire workspace as ZIP archive
- Path traversal protection and zip bomb mitigation

### ‚ú® API Enhancements

#### New Endpoints
- `POST /api/agents/launch` - Launch agents from presets or inline configs
- `GET /api/agents/sessions` - List all active agent sessions
- `GET /api/agents/sessions/{session_id}` - Get session details
- `DELETE /api/agents/sessions/{session_id}` - Stop and remove session
- `POST /api/agents/{session_id}/chat` - Claude-native chat endpoint with SSE
- `GET /api/configs/` - List available agent configurations
- `GET /api/configs/{config_id}` - Get specific configuration details
- `GET /api/files/{session_id}` - Browse workspace files
- `GET /api/files/{session_id}/{path}` - Preview file content
- `POST /api/files/{session_id}/download` - Download workspace as ZIP

#### Breaking Changes
- **REMOVED**: `/chat/completions` OpenAI-compatible endpoint
  - **Migration**: Use `/api/agents/launch` + `/api/agents/{session_id}/chat` instead
  - New approach provides better session management and configuration control
- **CHANGED**: Session management now config-based instead of conversation-ID based
  - Sessions must be explicitly launched with a configuration
  - Auto-cleanup still active (30-minute idle timeout)

### üîí Security Improvements
- Path traversal protection for file operations
- Session-based authorization with API key verification
- CORS whitelist configuration
- Zip bomb protection (max 100 files, 100MB limit)
- Container security hardening maintained

### üß™ Testing & CI/CD
- **NEW**: GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with 3 jobs:
  - Unit tests (Python 3.11, 3.12)
  - Integration tests with Docker setup
  - Linting (ruff, black)
- Comprehensive provider tests (Docker and Fly Machines)
- E2E test suite for Claude SDK native flows
- Builder configuration API tests
- Codecov integration for coverage reporting

### üì¶ Dependencies
- **NEW**: Dependabot configuration for automated dependency updates
  - Python (pip) packages
  - GitHub Actions
  - Docker images
  - npm packages (UI)

### üìö Documentation
- **NEW**: `CLAUDE.md` - Comprehensive guide for Claude Code
- **NEW**: `PROVIDERS.md` - Multi-provider architecture documentation (653 lines)
- **NEW**: `configs/README.md` - Complete configuration reference with examples
- **NEW**: `docs/providers/fly_machines.md` - Fly.io deployment guide
- **UPDATED**: Main README with Web UI documentation and new API reference
- **UPDATED**: UI README with implemented features
- **REMOVED**: `docs/architecture.md` (content consolidated into main README)
- **REMOVED**: `docs/quickstart.md` (merged into main README Quick Start)
- **REMOVED**: `examples/librechat/` (replaced by Web UI)

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Changes
- Session management redesigned for config-based launching
- Provider abstraction layer with factory pattern
- Configuration loading system with preset discovery
- File operations service with security controls
- WebSocket communication replaced with HTTP/SSE (partially)

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- Fixed container readiness detection reliability
- Improved error handling in provider implementations
- Enhanced session cleanup logic
- Resolved race conditions in concurrent session creation

### üîß Internal Changes
- Code formatting with Black applied to all Python files
- Linting errors resolved with ruff
- Type hints improved (mypy validation removed from CI)
- Test structure reorganized (unit, integration, e2e)
- Provider implementations refactored for consistency
